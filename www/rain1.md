<b><h1>Average Monthly Precipitation in the Month and Year of Collection</b></h1>
<br>
<h4><p>
In this section you can generate boxplots and beeswarm plots of the minimum, maximum and average monthly precipitation at the date (month + year) and location of collection for various subgroups of fungi.<br>
<b>Only entries with recorded coordinates, a nearby weather station, and data associated with the user selected parameter are included in this visualization.</b><br>
Each specimen meeting these requirements contributes one datapoint. A specimen is defined here as the combination of an organism's species, location, and date of collection. I.e two species collected at the same location on different dates are two separate specimens. Weather information for this visualization was obtained from www.worldclim.org </p>
