<center><h4>Countries are coloured from light blue (lowest) to dark purple (highest) number of specimen collections of the selected species.<br>
The number of specimens collected in each country can be identified by mousing over the geographic region of interest, or by using the data table below. A specimen is defined here as the combination of an organism's species, location, and date of collection. I.e two species collected at the same location on different dates are two separate specimens </p></h4></center>
