<b><h1>Collections Through Time</h1></b>
<br>
<h4>
<p>
In this section you can explore fungal collections over time. <br>
Select a date resolution, as well as a start and end date below. Year and Month inputs are inclusive.<br>
<b> Only entries with a date recorded to the user selected date resolution are included in this visualization. </b> <br>
Note: The # entries with at least the year recorded > # entries with at least the year and month recorded > # of entries with the year, month, and day recorded. <br>
Therefore, a lower date resolution will have more data included (i.e year will return more datapoints than year-month).
