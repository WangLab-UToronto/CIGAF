Hover over a column to see additional details. The Bar plot on the left shows stacked raw fungal specimen counts with each associated host for a user defined x axis. The plot on the right shows the proportion (from 0 to 1) of associated insect host family for the user defined X axis category. A specimen is defined here as the combination of an organism's species, location, and date of collection. I.e two species collected at the same location on different dates are two separate specimens.<br></p></h4></center>
