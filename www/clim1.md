<b><h1>Average Monthly Air Temperature in the Month and Year of Collection</b></h1>
<br>
<h4><p>
In this section you can generate box plots of the minimum, maximum and average monthly temperature at the date (month + year) and location of collection for various subgroups of the collected fungi.<br>
<b>Only entries with recorded coordinates, a nearby weather station, and data associated with the user selected parameter are included in this visualization.</b><br>
Each specimen meeting these requirements contributes one data point. A specimen is defined here as the combination of an organisms species, location, and date of collection. I.e two species collected at the same location on different dates are two separate specimens. Weather information for this visualization was obtained from www.worldclim.org </p>
