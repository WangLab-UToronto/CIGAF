<b><h1>Ecoregions - Exploring Habitat Types </h1></b>
<br>
<h4>
<p>
<br>
In this section you can generate a histogram of specimen counts for a taxonomic group of your choice by the ecoregion in which they were collected. 
<br>
Use the x-axis drop down menue to select your prefered ecoregion descriptor. "Realm" is the least detailed habitat descriptor and "Eco_name" is the most detailed. <br>
<b>Note: Only entries with recorded coordinates are included in this visualization.</b><br>
<br>
Ecoregion data was obtained from the 2017 Resolve Ecoregions and Biomes Map, available
